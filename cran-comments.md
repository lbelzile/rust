## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.  In this version I have 

* Added devtools to `Suggests:' in DESCRIPTION to avoid the following NOTE: 

   * checking for unstated dependencies in vignettes ... NOTE
    '::' or ':::' import not declared from: ‘devtools’
    
* Added the DOI number to the reference in the DESCRIPTION file.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies

This is a new submission.
